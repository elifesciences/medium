            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lubricated joints evolved millions of years earlier than previously thought.</p><p>Central Africa is home to the second largest tropical rainforest in the world. Previous studies showed that few young trees of light-demanding species were growing to replace the old trees in this forest. As a result this population is aging and at risk of disappearing, which is a major concern. Many light-demanding tree species in the Central African forest are cut down for their valuable timber. However, if young trees do not grow to replace the mature ones that are logged, even logging operations that follow national and international environmental rules cannot guarantee the sustainability of these trees.</p><p>As such, <strong>Julie Morin-Rivat, Adeline Fayolle and colleagues</strong> set out to understand what changed in the Central African forest in the past to stop the regeneration of the light-demanding trees. The analyses focused on four species classified as light-demanding trees in part of Central Africa called the northern Congo Basin. Most of the trees in these species were about 165 years old. This was the case even though the different species grow at different rates, and it means that they all grew from young trees that settled in the middle of the 19th century.</p><p>So what was it that changed after this period to stop this population of light-demanding trees in the Central African forest from regenerating? By combining information from a number of datasets and historical records, Morin-Rivat, Fayolle and colleagues arrived at the following conclusion. Before the mid-19th century, many people lived in the forest and their activities created clearings that turned the forest into a relatively patchy landscape. However from about 1850 onwards, when Europeans started to colonize the region, people and villages were moved out of the forests and closer to rivers and roads for administrative and commercial purposes. Moreover, many people were killed in conflicts or died because of newly introduced diseases, which also led to fewer people in the forest. As a result, the forest became less disturbed. With fewer clearings, fewer light-demanding trees would have had enough access to sunlight to grow to maturity.</p><p>The findings of Morin-Rivat, Fayolle and colleagues show that disturbance is needed to maintain certain forest habitats and tree species, including light-demanding species of tree. As common logging operations do not create openings large enough to guarantee that such species will be able to establish themselves naturally, complementary treatments are needed. These might include selectively logging mature trees around young members of light-demanding species, or planting threatened species.</p><h3>To find out more</h3><blockquote><em>Read the </em>eLife<em> research paper on which this eLife digest is based: </em><strong><em>“</em></strong><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20343"><strong><em>Present-day central African forest is a legacy of the 19th century human history</em></strong></a><strong><em>”</em></strong> <em>(January 17, 2017).</em></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>
